# Reading Blogs Assignment Supermetrics

Hi, This is Anh. I made this small app as Supermetrics assignment in hope of becoming Junior Front-end React Developer.

Thank you for coming and enjoy using the app. :)

## Tech Stacks.

- HTML, CSS.
- React, Redux, Redux-Persist.

## Plan for Improvements.

- Better form validation.
- Private route for single blog post.
- Implement debounce function on user input search.
- React lazy and Suspense for better performance.
- TypeScript version and using React Testing Library (Jest).

## What I learnt from the assignment.

- A better planning for the app. I did not quite understand the "Deep linkable post" feature, so I decided to tackle it at last. It turnt out a bad decision due to bad planning. :D I had to change the whole app structure to get "Deep linkable post" feature working.
- What does it mean "deep linking" list item? Simply user can access list item by entering the direct URL and it will point to the list item itself. Long story short, one URL for one list item.
